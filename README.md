This was the final project for my computer science web development class
A partner and myself were able to create a site that takes random flights from a database
and constructs a spotify playlist for the user based on where the flight is going. They can also see random
images from unsplash.com and create their own flight. The spotify keys have been removed and the department's server is
behind a firewall but if you would like to see a video of the app feel free to email me at amitenand@gmail.com
